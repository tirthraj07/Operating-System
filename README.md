### Laboratory Practice 1 : System Programming and Operating Systems + Distributed Systems

This repo contains the assignments during Laboratory Practice - 1 : (SPOS + DS) 

#### Table of Contents

<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Assembler Pass 1</td>
<td>
Design  suitable  data  structures  and  implement  pass-I  of  a  two-pass assembler  for  pseudo-machine.  Implementation  should  consist  of a few instructions from each category and few assembler directives.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Assembler Pass 2</td>
<td>
Design  suitable  data  structures  and  implement  pass-II  of  a two-pass assembler for pseudo-machine. Implementation should 
consist  of  a  few  instructions  from  each  category  and  few assembler directives.  The  output  of  Pass-I  (intermediate  code  file  and  symbol table) should be input for pass-II. 
</td>

<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Macroprocessor Pass 1</td>
<td>
Design  suitable  data  structures  and  implement  Pass-I  of  a two-pass  macro-  processor.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Macroprocessor Pass 2</td>
<td>
Design  suitable  data  structures  and  implement  Pass-II  of  a two-pass  macro-  processor.  The  output  of  Pass-I  (MNT,  MDT  and 
intermediate  code  file  without  any  macro  definitions)  should  be  input 
for Pass-II.

<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>CPU Scheduling</td>
<td>
Write  a  program  to  simulate  CPU  Scheduling Algorithms:  FCFS,  SJF 
(Preemptive), Priority (Non-Preemptive) and Round Robin (Preemptive). 
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>Memory Management</td>

Note:
I highly recommend to perform the practicals in Python during examination due to time constraints
